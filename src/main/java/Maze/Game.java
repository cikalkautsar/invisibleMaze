                           Invisible Maze is a maze-based adventure game where players must navigate paths that are hidden from view.
                           At the beginning of the game, players are given a short amount of time to see the original map.
                           After that, the maze becomes invisible, and players must rely on memory to find the correct path with a limited number of moves.
                           This game challenges the player's memory, focus, and strategy as they progress through increasingly difficult levels.""");
